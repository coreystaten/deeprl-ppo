This is an implementation of [proximal policy optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06347).   I made this as part of my work getting up to speed in Deep RL under a grant from the [Machine Intelligence Research Institute](https://intelligence.org/).  I left many of my debug notes in intentionally, in hopes they might be helpful to anyone else attempting a similar project.

If all prerequisites are installed, type "python ppo.py" to run in the default configuration on Pong.
